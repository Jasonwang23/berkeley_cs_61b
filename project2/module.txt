  1)  determining whether a move is valid,
	Board:
	boolean isValidMove(Move m)
	
	
  2)  generating a list of all valid moves,
	Board:
	List allValidMoves()
	
  3)  finding the chips (of the same color) that form connections with a chip,
	Board:
	List connectedChips()
	
	
  4)  determining whether a game board contains any networks for a given
      player (very difficult; put your smartest teammate on this),
	
	
  5)  computing an evaluation function for a board (possibly difficult), and


  6)  performing minimax tree search (difficult).
